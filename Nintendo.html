	<div><h1> The Rise and Fall of a Video Game Giant</h1></div>
		<p>In 1983 the first Nintendo (NES) came out. It was extremely successful. Popular names like Mario, Donkey Kong and Link became household names for generations to come. It was a simple system that was fun and easy to use for all. The graphics were basic and primitive, but that did not stop enthusiasts from spending countless hours playing the system. The sysem has one main box and 2 controllers that people would use. Then a cartridge was placed into the box and with a flick of a button, history was made. If the game was not working, people would simply blow on the cartridge and then the game would miraculously work like magic. As time went on, the video game market became lucrative. Nintendo went up against competition and cash cows like (Sega, Atari playstation and more recently XBox.) Nintendo has stood the test of time, however it seems to finally fallen from on high and seems to be in the dust from competitors like Playstation and XBox. With its simple characters and easy game play, it just cannot keep up with the high powered and intensity of game play that the former systems can offer. Will nintendo stand a chance and make a comeback? Only time will tell. I certainly hope so. Regardless of what happens, Nintendo forever changed the video game industry as we know it and will always be known as a distruptive force in the video game field.</p>
